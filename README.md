# speedmath.live

Online real time math game - kahoot inspired. You answer math equations as fast as possible and get points based on speed, competing against the other players in real time. This is built using web-sockets. After 10 rounds there is a podium and the game resets. The site has previously been hosted at speedmath.live, but is not hosted currently.
